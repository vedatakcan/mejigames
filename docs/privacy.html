        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> December 5, 2025</p>

        <p>
            This Privacy Policy explains how Meji (“we,” “our,” or “us”) handles your information when you use our mobile application, Meji (the “Application”). By using the Application, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>
            We do not collect, store, or process any personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name, email address, phone number, or contact details.
        </p>
        <p>
            All gameplay progress, scores, settings, and preferences are stored locally on your device via a Room database. This data is never uploaded to any server and cannot be accessed, restored, or viewed by the Developer.
        </p>
        <p>
            We may collect limited non-personal information automatically for functionality, analytics, advertising, and app performance purposes, including:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Diagnostics:</strong> Crash logs, performance data, and app stability metrics.</li>
            <li><strong>App Activity:</strong> Button clicks, screen views, and interaction patterns.</li>
            <li><strong>Device IDs:</strong> Device model, OS version, language, and Google AdMob advertising ID.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The Application uses the following third-party services:</p>

        <ul>

                <strong>Google AdMob</strong> – Used to display advertisements.  
                AdMob may collect device identifiers, app interactions, and advertising data.  
                <br><a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank">Google AdMob Privacy Policy</a>
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Google Play Billing</strong> – Used to process in-app purchases and subscriptions.  
                Payment information is handled exclusively by Google and is never accessible to the Developer.

            </li>
        </ul>

            <li>App interactions</li>
            <li>Device IDs (functionality, analytics, advertising)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Data Security</h2>
        <p>
            Your gameplay data is stored securely on your device only. If you delete or reinstall the Application, or if your device malfunctions, your data may be permanently lost. The Developer cannot retrieve or restore this data.
        </p>
        <p>
            Any data collected by third-party providers (such as AdMob or Google Play Billing) is handled according to their own security practices.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Local Data:</strong> Stored on your device and removed only when you uninstall or clear app data.
